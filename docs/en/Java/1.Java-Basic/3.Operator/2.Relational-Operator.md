# Relational Operators

âœ… Also known as comparison operators.

ðŸ“Œ The result of relational operators is always a **boolean** type. Relational expressions are often used in conditional statements or loop structures.

| Operator | Operation | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal to | 7 == 3 | false |
| != | Not equal to | 7 != 3 | true |
| < | Less than | 7 < 3 | false |
| > | Greater than | 7 > 3 | true |
| <= | Less than or equal to | 7 <= 3 | false |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | 7 >= 3 | true |
| instanceof | Checks if it's an instance of a class | `"Hello" instanceof String` | true |

Basic usage:

```java
System.out.println(4 != 3);   // True

int a = 3;
int b = 8;
System.out.println(a == b);  // False
boolean flag = a < b;        // flag = True
```
