# Ternary Operator

## Basic Syntax

💡 `[Conditional Expression] ? [true -> Expression 1] : [false -> Expression 2];`

- If the conditional expression is true, the result of the operation is Expression 1.
- If the conditional expression is false, the result of the operation is Expression 2.



### Assignment Order using Ternary Operator

The assignment order of `++` and `--` still applies.

```java
int i = 10;
int j = i;		// j = 10, i = 10
    j = i++;	// j = 10, i = 11
```

```java
int i = 10;
int j = i;		// j = 10, i = 10
    j = ++i;	// j = 11, i = 11
```


Post-increment/decrement -> assign first, then increment/decrement.

```java
int a = 10, b = 99;
int result = a > b ? a++ : b--;    
// First returns the value of b, then b--. The value stored in result is 99, but the final value of b is 98.
```

Pre-increment/decrement -> increment/decrement first, then assign.

```java
int a = 10, b = 99;
int result = a < b ? a++ : --b;  
// First a--, then returns the value of a. The value stored in result is 98, and the final value of b is also 98.
```



### Data Types using Ternary Operator

**The data type of the variable after `++` or `--` is the one we have defined. Compound assignment operators perform automatic type casting.**

```java
byte a = 3, b = 8;
byte c = a > b ? ++a : --a;
// Equivalent to a = (byte)(a - 1);
```



**The expressions in the ternary operator (Expression 1 and Expression 2) must be of the type that can be assigned to the receiving variable, or they can be automatically converted.**

✅ `int -> int`

```java
int a = 3, b = 8;
int c = a > b ? a : b;
// a, b, c are all int, so there is no type conversion issue.
```

✅ Automatically convert `int -> double`

```java
double c = a > b ? 1 + 0.1 : 3.4;
// c is of type double and can receive 1.1 and 3.4.
```

❌ `double -> int`

```java
int a = 3, b = 8;
int c = a > b ? 1.1 : 3.4;
// c is of type int and cannot receive double values 1.1 and 3.4.
```

✅ Type cast `double -> int`

```java
int c = a > b ? (int)1.1 : (int)3.4;
// c is of type int, and 1.1 and 3.4 are cast to int.
```
