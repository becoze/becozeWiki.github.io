# Bitwise Operators

ðŸ”¥ a >> b = a divided by 2 raised to the power of b.
a << b = a multiplied by 2 raised to the power of b.

**Arithmetic Right Shift**`>>`: Shifts right, and fills the leftmost bits with the sign bit.

**Arithmetic Left Shift**`<<`: Shifts left, and fills the rightmost bits with 0.

**Logical Right Shift**, also known as unsigned right shift`>>>`: Shifts right, and fills the leftmost bits with 0.

Note: There is no <<< operator.

```java
int a = 1 >> 2;    // 1 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2 = 0
// 1. Binary representation of 1: 00000001 
// 2. Shift 2 bits to the right:  0  00000 (sign bit shifted 2 positions)
// 3. Fill with sign bit:        00000000

int b = -1 >> 2;  // -1 divided by 2 raised to the power of 2 = 0
int c = 1 << 2;   // 1 multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 2 = 4
int c = -1 << 2;  // -1 multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 2 = -4
