# Logical Operators

ðŸ“Œ Used to combine multiple conditions (multiple relational expressions), and the final result is also a boolean value.

**`&` Logical AND `a & b`:** If both a and b are true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

**`&&` Short-Circuit AND `a && b`:** If both a and b are true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

**`|` Logical OR `a || b`:** If either a or b is true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

**`||` Short-Circuit OR `a || b`:** If either a or b is true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

**`!` NOT or Negation `!a`**: If a is true, the result is false; if a is false, the result is true.

**`^` Logical XOR (Exclusive OR) `a ^ b`:** If a and b are different, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

| a     | b     | -->  | `a&b` | `a&&b` | `a\|b` | `a\|\|b` | `!a`  | `a^b` |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | -------- | ----- | ----- |
| true  | true  | -->  | true  | true   | true   | true     | false | false |
| true  | false | -->  | false | false  | true   | true     | false | true  |
| false | true  | -->  | false | false  | true   | true     | true  | true  |
| false | false | -->  | false | false  | false  | false    | true  | false |



## `&` Logical AND and `&&` Short-Circuit AND

**AND: When both conditions on both sides are true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.**

- `&&` Short-Circuit AND: If the first condition is false, the second condition is not evaluated, and the result is false. This is more efficient.
- `&` Logical AND: Regardless of whether the first condition is false, the second condition is still evaluated. This is less efficient.

ðŸ’¡ In development, we usually use short-circuit AND `&&` because it is more efficient.



**The Difference Between `&&` Short-Circuit AND and `&` Logical AND - Whether the second condition is evaluated:**

- `&&` Short-Circuit AND: If the first condition is true, the second condition is not evaluated.
- `&` Logical AND: Both conditions are evaluated.

```java
int a = 0; int b = 9;

boolean result = a == 0 && ++b < 50;   // If the first condition is false, the second condition is not evaluated.
// a = 0;  b = 9;  result = false      // ++b was not executed

boolean result = a == 0 & ++b < 50;    // The second condition is still evaluated.
// a = 0;  b = 10;  result = false     // ++b was executed
```



## `|` Logical OR and `||` Short-Circuit OR

**OR: If at least one of the conditions is true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.**

- `||` Short-Circuit OR: If the first condition is true, the second condition is not evaluated. This is more efficient.
- `|` Logical OR: Regardless of whether the first condition is true, the second condition is still evaluated. This is less efficient.

ðŸ’¡ In development, we usually use short-circuit OR `||` because it is more efficient.

**The Difference Between `|` Logical OR and `||` Short-Circuit OR - Whether the second condition is evaluated:**

```java
int a = 0; int b = 9;

boolean result = a == 0 || ++b < 50;   // If the first condition is true, the second condition is not evaluated.
// a = 0;  b = 9;  result = true       // ++b was not executed

boolean result = a == 0 | ++b < 50;    // The second condition is still evaluated.
// a = 0;  b = 10;  result = true      // ++b was executed
```



## `!` NOT (Negation)

**NOT: true becomes false, and false becomes true.**

```java
boolean boo1 = 60 < 20;
boolean boo1 = !(60 < 20);
```



## `^` Logical XOR

**XOR: When both sides are different, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.**

```java
boolean boo1 = (10 > 1) ^ (3 < 5);
//               True   ^  True
// result is false 
```

```java
boolean boo2 = (10 > 1) ^ (3 > 5);
//               True   ^  False
