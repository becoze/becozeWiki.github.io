# Assignment Operators

- The left side of an assignment operator can only be a variable `=`, while the right side can be a variable, expression, or constant value.
    - `private int num3 = a;`
    
- Equivalent forms of assignment operators
  
  
    | Symbol | Example | Equivalent To |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | = | int a = b; |  |
    | += | int a += b; | int a = a + b; |
    | -= | int a -= b; | int a = a - b; |
    | /= | int a /= b; | int a = a / b; |
    | *= | int a *= b; | int a = a * b; |
    
- When using compound assignment operators (e.g., `++, --, +=, -=...`), the data type is based on the type we have defined, not the default type (e.g., integer by default, floating-point by default).

    ```java
    byte b = 3;  
    b += 10; 
    // Equivalent to
    b = (byte)(3 + 10); // 3b is of type byte, so a type cast is necessary
    
    byte b = 3; 
    b++;
    // Equivalent to
    b = (byte)(3 + 1);
    ```
