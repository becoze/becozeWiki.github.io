# Naming Rules for Identifiers

## Naming Rules - Must

ðŸ”‘ Any place where you can give a name is called an identifier.

ðŸ“Œ The character sequence used for naming variables, methods, and classes is called an identifier.

1. An identifier consists of 26 English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers 0-9, underscore `_`, or dollar sign `$`.
2. An identifier cannot contain spaces.
3. Numbers cannot be used as the starting character. For example: `int 3ab = 1;`
4. You cannot use keywords and reserved words, but you can include them in the identifier. For example: `class, static, public`
5. Java is case-sensitive, and there is no limit to the length of an identifier.
- Examples

    ```java
    nick1   // ok
    nick    // ok
    1nick   // 3. Numbers cannot be used as the starting character
    n-k     // 1. The identifier does not include the "-" sign
    n k     // 2. Cannot contain spaces
    k$4     // ok
    class   // 4. Cannot include java keywords
    int     // 4. Cannot include java keywords
    goto    // 4. Cannot include java reserved words
    k1_name // ok
    ```

## Naming Conventions - Suggested

- **Package Names:** When multiple words are used, all letters should be lowercase: `aaa.bbb.ccc`
    - For example: `com.becoze.me`
- **Class and Interface Names:** When multiple words are used, capitalize the initial letter of each word (CamelCase): `XxxYyyZzz`.
    - For example: `UserControll`
- **Variable and Method Names:** When multiple words are used, the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter (camelCase): `xxxYyyZzz`.
    - For example: `userLogin`
- **Constant Names:** All letters should be uppercase. When multiple words are used, each word is separated by an underscore `_`: `XXX_YYY_ZZZ`.
    - For example: Defining a tax rate as `TAX_RATE`
