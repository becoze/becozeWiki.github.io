# Number Systems & Conversion

**Binary (base-2):** 0, 1. Prefixed with 0b or 0B. Example: `0b011`

**Octal (base-8):** 0-7. Prefixed with 0. Example: `0147`

**Decimal (base-10):** 0-9.

**Hexadecimal (base-16):** 0-9 and A(10)-F(15). Prefixed with 0x or 0X. Case-insensitive for A-F. Example: `0xe543b1`

```java
int bin = 0b1010;  // 10
int oct = 01010;   // 520
int dec = 1010;    // 1010
int hex = 0xb1010; // 65793
```

## Conversion from x to Decimal

ðŸ“Œ Multiply each digit by the power of x (position - 1) and then sum them.

### Binary to Decimal

`0b1011`

| Binary | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Calculation ... | 1x2^3 | 0x2^2 | 1x2^1 | 1x2^0 |
| ... Result | 8 | 0 | 2 | 1 |

= 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = `11`

### Octal to Decimal

`0234` = 2x8^2 + 3x8^1 + 4x8^0 = 128 + 24 + 4 = `156`

### Hexadecimal to Decimal

`0x23A` = 2x16^2 + 3x16^1 + 10x16^0 = 512 + 48 + 10 = `570`



## Decimal to x Conversion

ðŸ“Œ Divide the number continuously by x until the quotient is 0, then reverse the remainders obtained at each step.

### Decimal to Binary

`34`= `0b 0010 0010`

```java
34 / 2 = 17... 0;  
		 17 / 2 = 8... 1;  
			  	  8 / 2 = 4... 0;  
				 		  4 / 2 = 2... 0;  
								  2 / 2 = 1... 0;  
                        				  1 / 2 = 0... 1;
```



### Decimal to Octal

`131`= `0 203`

```java
131 / 8 = 16... 3;  
		  16 /  8 = 2... 0; 
					2 / 8 = 0... 2;  
```



### Decimal to Hexadecimal

`237`= `0xED`

```java
237 / 16 = 14... 13; // D  
		   14 / 16 = 0... 14; // E
```





## Binary to Octal, Hexadecimal

ðŸ“Œ For octal, group every 3 bits; for hexadecimal, group every 4 bits.

## Octal, Hexadecimal to Binary


ðŸ“Œ For octal and hexadecimal numbers, convert each digit to the corresponding 3 and 4 binary bits respectively.

### Octal to Binary

`0237` = 2(`010`) 3(`011`) 7(`111`) = 010 011 111 = `0b 1001 1111`
