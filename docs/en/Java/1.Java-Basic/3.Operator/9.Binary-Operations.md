# Binary Operations

## Sign Bit, Ones' Complement, Twos' Complement

> Ones' Complement abbreviated as Ones' .
>
> Twos' Complement abbreviated as Twos' .

- The leftmost (most significant) bit in binary is the sign bit: 0 for positive, 1 for negative (Mnemonic: 0 -> 0; 1 -> -).

- ALL three sign-bit, ones' and twos' of positive numbers are the same.

- The ones' and twos' of 0 are 0s.

- The **ones' of a negative number** is obtained by flipping all the bits (0 -> 1, 1 -> 0).

- The **twos' of a negative number** is obtained by adding 1 to its ones' complement.

- The **ones' of a negative number** is obtained by subtracting 1 from its twos' complement.

- Java does not have unsigned integers; all numbers are signed.

- In computer arithmetic, operations are performed using the twos' complement representation.

  

## Rules for Bitwise Operators

ðŸ”¥ Number `a` <â€”> Original Representation <â€”> Ones' Complement <â€”> Twos' Complement (during operations)

1. Obtain the original representation of `a`.
2. (For negative numbers) Obtain the ones' complement of `a`.
3. Obtain the twos' complement of `a`.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for all numbers in the expression.
5. Perform the operation based on the twos' complement representation.
6. Obtain the result's original representation.

## Bitwise AND `&`

**Returns 1 where both bits are 1; otherwise, returns 0.**

220 | 134 = 132

```java
1101 1100
1000 0110
---------
1000 0100
```

`2 & 3 = ?` "Bitwise AND of 2 and 3"

```java
System.out.println(2 & 3);
// Binary representation of 2:  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010
// Binary representation of 3:  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011

// Twos' complement of 2:       00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 (Positive: Same as original)
// Twos' complement of 3:       00000000 00000000 00000000 00000011 (Positive: Same as original)
// Twos' complement of 2 & 3:   00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 
// Original representation:     00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 (Positive: Same as original)
// Result = 2
```

## Bitwise OR `|`

**Returns 1 where at least one bit is 1; otherwise, returns 0.**

220 | 134 = 222

```java
1101 1100
1000 0110
---------
1101 1110
```

## Bitwise XOR `^`

Returns 1 where one bit is 0 and the other is 1; otherwise, returns 0.

220 ^ 134 = 90

```java
1101 1100
1000 0110
---------
0101 1010
```

## Bitwise NOT `~`: 0 -> 1, 1 -> 0

~220 = 35

```java
1101 1100
---------
0010 0011
```

`~-2 = 1`

```java
System.out.println(~-2);
// Original representation of -2: 10000000 00000000 00000000 00000010
// Ones' complement of -2:        11111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 (Negative: Same as original)
// Twos' complement of -2:        11111111 11111111 11111111 11111110 (Negative: Ones' complement + 1)
// Bitwise NOT of -2:             00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 
// Original representation:       00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001 (Positive: Same as original)
// Result = 1
```

`~2 = -3`

```java
System.out.println(~2);
// Original representation of 2:  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010
// Twos' complement of 2:         00000000 00000000 00000000 00000010 (Positive: Same as original)
// Bitwise NOT of 2:              11111111 11111111 11111111 11111101 (Negative: Twos' complement - 1)
// Ones' complement of -3:        11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100 (Negative: Twos' complement - 1)
// Original representation:       10000000 00000000 00000000 00000011 
// Result = -3
