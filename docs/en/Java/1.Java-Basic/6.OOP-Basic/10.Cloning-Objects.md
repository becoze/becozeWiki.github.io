# Cloning Objects

ðŸ’¡ Cloning an object, similar to cloning an array, involves allocating a (new) independent memory space for the new object and then copying the data one by one.

> Directly assigning (`new = old;`) won't work; it just makes both references point to the same object. The actual memory space is still shared.

Q: Write a method `copyPerson` that can copy a `Person` object and return the copied object. When cloning an object, it's important to ensure that the new object and the original object are two independent objects with the same properties.

```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Person p1 = new Person();
		p1.name = "Nick";
		p1.age = 22;

		MyTools myTools = new MyTools();
		Person p2 = myTools.copyPerson(p1);
	}
}

class Person{
	String name;
	int age;
}

class MyTools{                          // defining a tools class
	public Person copyPerson(Person p){	// returning a Person
		Person new_p = new Person();	// newing an object/reference type, unlike primitive types, which disappear when current method ends
		new_p.name = p.name;			// Assigning the values of the copied object one by one to the new object.
		new_p.age = p.age;

		return new_p;		
	}
}
```

**Verify Independence of Objects by Comparing Them**

```java
System.out.println(p1 == p2); // false, p1 and p2 are independent
System.out.println(p1 == p1); // true, p1 is still p1
```
