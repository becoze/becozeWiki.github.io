# Class and Object

ðŸ’¡ **Class** is a data type we provide, and we can customize its attributes and methods (behavior).
What is Data types? Built-in types like Object and String in Java, Assert class in Spring (classes defined by others), and logically, our self-defined classes are similar to these.

ðŸ“Œ Attributes (field) and methods (Method) constitute a class.
A class is like a player model in a game,
Attributes are like the basic properties of the player, e.g., hp, mp, str, dex, luck.
Methods are like the interactive logic of the player, e.g., attack, dodge, casting.

ðŸ‘¾ Instantiate a class to create an object.
An object is like a specific object/person under the player model, e.g., the player, NPC the shop owner, NPC the magic tutor.
