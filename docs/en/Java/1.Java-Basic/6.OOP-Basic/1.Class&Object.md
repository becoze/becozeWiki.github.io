# Class and Object

ðŸ’¡ **Class** is a data type we provide, and we can customize its attributes and methods (behavior).
What is Data types? Built-in types like Object and String in Java, Assert class in Spring (classes defined by others), and logically, our self-defined classes are similar to these.

ðŸ“Œ Attributes (field) and methods (Method) constitute a class.
A class is like a player model in a game,
Attributes are like the basic properties of the player, e.g., hp, mp, str, dex, luck.
Methods are like the interactive logic of the player, e.g., attack, dodge, casting.

ðŸ‘¾ Instantiate a class to create an object.
An object is like a specific object/person under the player model, e.g., the player, NPC the shop owner, NPC the magic tutor.





## Create Class, Properties, and Methods

### Format

Create in one step

```java
Cat whiteCat = new Cat();
```

Declare first, then create

```java
Cat whiteCat;         // Declare object
whiteCat = new Cat(); // Create, allocate memory
```

### Steps

1. Define a **class** (customize a data type). For example: `class Cat{}`
2. Define its **properties**.
    1. Common characteristics of objects.
    2. Data type.
    3. Property name.
3. Define its **methods**. For example: `String name;`
    1. Return data type. For example: void (no return), int, String, etc.
    2. Access modifier.
    3. Method name.
    4. Arguments.
    5. Method body.
4. **Instantiate objects**.
    1. Create an object. `new Cat();`
    2. Assign it to a variable of type `Cat`, like `cat1`.
5. **Invoke** properties and methods.

```java
public class work{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Cat cat1 = new Cat();  // 4. Create an object of type Cat and assign it to a variable
		Cat cat2 = new Cat();
		cat1.name = "Nick";    // 5. Invoke properties
		cat1.age = 3;
		cat2.name = "Alice";
		cat2.age = 2;

		cat1.run(30);          // 5. Invoke methods
		cat2.run(5);
	}
}
class Cat {      	// 1. Define a class
	String name;	// 2. Define its properties
	int age;

	public int run(int meters){   // 3. Define its methods
		System.out.println("Run " + meters + " meters.");
	}
}
```
