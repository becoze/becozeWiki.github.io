# Scope

üìå **Scope:** The scope of a variable.

## Scope Naming Conflict

- In the same scope, such as within the same method, two local variables cannot have the same name.
- Properties and local variables can have the same name, and when accessed, the principle of proximity is followed.

```java
class Methods{ 
	String name = "Nick"; 
	int age;

	public void m(){
		String name = "Arisu";		// is ok OK
		System.out.println(name);  	// Arisu
	}
}
```




## **Scope of Global & Local Variables:**

|  - | Global Variables, e.g. Fields | Local Variables |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | Fields in a class. | Variables other than properties. |
| Initialization Location | Defined in the class. | Defined in code blocks, usually within methods. |
| **Scope** | ‚úÖCan be used by this class and other classes (called by objects*). | ‚ùåShorter lifespan, recycled once the method is executed. |
| Lifespan | ‚úÖLonger lifespan, can be used until the object is deleted. | ‚ùåShorter lifespan, recycled once the method is executed. |
| Default Value | ‚úÖHas a default value; can be used directly. | ‚ùåNo default value; must be assigned before use. |
| Modifiers | ‚úÖCan have modifiers. | ‚ùåCannot have modifiers. |

```java
class Methods{ 
	// Global variable, fields
	String name; 
	int age;

	public void m(){
		// Local variable
		int a = 100;
		double b = 200.0;
	}
}
```



## Accessing properties outside of the scope.

`.`Direct invocation: Call the properties of the `Person` class in the `main` class.

```java
public class Work{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Person p1 = new Person();
		System.out.println( p1.name );   // "Nick"
	}
}

class Person{ 
	String name = "Nick"; 
	int age;
}
```



Calling properties of another class: Pass object `a` into object `b` to call the properties of `a`.

```java
public class Work{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		Tools t1 = new Tools();
		Person p1 = new Person();
		t1.test(p1);   // "Nick"
	}
}

class Tools {
	public void test(Methods m){
		System.out.println( m.name ); 
	}
}

class Person{ 
	String name = "Nick"; 
	int age;
}
```
