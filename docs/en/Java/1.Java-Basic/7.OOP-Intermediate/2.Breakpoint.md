# Debugging

**F7 (step into):** Jump into the method

**alt + shift + F7** (Force step into)

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] arr = {5, 60, -1, 0, 32, 10};
    Arrays.sort(arr);   // <-- Arrays.sort() is a method. F7 or alt + shift + F7 to step into
}
```

> Setting → Build Execution Deployment → Debugger → Stepping → Do not step into the classes "java." and "javax."

**F8 (step over)**: Execute code line by line

**shift + F8 (step out)**: Jump out of the method. Complete the remaining statements in the current method and return to the next statement in the method referenced in the upper layer.

**F9 (resume program):** Execute until the next breakpoint
