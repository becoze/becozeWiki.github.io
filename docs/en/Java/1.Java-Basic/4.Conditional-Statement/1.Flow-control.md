# Control Flow in Programming

## Sequential Control

Sequential control is the default behavior where the program executes instructions in the order they appear, from top to bottom.

## Flow Control

Flow control refers to mechanisms in programming languages that control the order in which statements are executed. It includes:

1. **Sequential Control:** The default execution order, where statements are executed one after the other from top to bottom.

2. **Branching (Conditional Statements):** Deciding whether to execute a certain block of code based on a condition. In Java, this is done using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.

3. **Looping (Repetition Statements):** Repeating a block of code multiple times based on a condition. In Java, common loop structures are `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

4. **Jump Statements:** These statements alter the normal flow of program execution.

    - **`break`:** Exits a loop or a switch statement.
    
    - **`continue`:** Skips the rest of the loop's code and continues with the next iteration.
    
    - **`return`:** Exits a method and can also return a value.
    
    - **`throw`:** Used to signal that an exceptional condition has occurred.

    - **`try`, `catch`, `finally`:** Used for exception handling.

Flow control allows developers to create flexible and dynamic programs by making decisions and repeating actions based on certain conditions.
