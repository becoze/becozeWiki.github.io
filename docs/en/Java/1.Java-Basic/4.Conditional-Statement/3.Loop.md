# ‚≠ê Loop and Jump

## `for`

The `for` loop is one of the most commonly used loop structures in Java, providing a convenient way to initialize, test a condition, and iterate a loop variable.

```java
for (initialization; loop condition; loop iteration) {
    // Loop body (code to be repeated)
}

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

- Four elements of a loop:
    - **Initialization:** Executed at the beginning of the loop, usually the initialization of the loop variable.
    - **Loop Condition:** Evaluated at the start of each iteration. If the condition is `true`, the loop body is executed. If the condition is `false`, the loop is exited.
    - **Loop Iteration:** Executed at the end of each iteration, typically updating the loop variable.
    - **Loop body**


### Usage

* `init_statement` and `alter_statement` can be done outside the `for` loop. In this case, `init_statement` and `alter_statement` can be omitted in the `for` loop header: 

  ```java
  int i = 1;
  for( ; i <= 5 ; ){
      if(i > 0 ) { 
          i += 2; 
      }
  }
  ```

  

- Similar to `if`, if there is only one statement for the loop operation, the curly braces `{ }` can be omitted, but it's recommended to remove them for clarity.
- The difference between `while` and `for`: the initialization and iteration in `while` are done outside the loop body, while in `for`, they are part of the loop header.
- Infinite loop is usually controlled using `break`: `for( ; ; ){ }`



### Common Use Cases

Iterating through an array

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```



## while & do-while

üìå The key difference between `while` and `do-while` is that `while` tests the condition first before executing the loop body, and it might not execute the loop body at all. On the other hand, `do-while` executes the loop body at least once before testing the condition.

### while

```java
1. Initialization of loop variable;
while (2. Loop condition) {
	3. Loop operation;
	4. Iteration of loop variable;
}
```

- Tests the condition first before executing the loop body. It might not execute the loop body at all.
- The difference between `while` and `for`: the initialization and iteration in `while` are done outside the loop body, while in `for`, they are part of the loop header.
- Four elements of a loop: Initialization, Loop condition, body, iteration.

### do-while

```java
1. Initialization of loop variable;
do {
	2. Loop operation;
	3. Iteration of loop variable;
} while (4. Loop condition);
```

- Executes the loop body first before testing the condition. It ensures that the loop body is executed at least once.
- Ends with a semicolon `;`.
- `do-while` also has the four elements of a loop; they are just arranged differently.



## Nested

üí° Nesting occurs when one complete branch/loop structure is embedded within another complete branch/loop structure. It's generally advisable not to exceed three levels of nesting for better readability.

```java
for (...) {
    for (...) {
        // body
    }
}
```



## break

üìå The `break` statement is used to terminate the execution of a loop (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) or a `switch-case`.

## label

üìå `break` with a label allows you to terminate a specific loop when there are nested loops. If no label is specified with `break`, it defaults to exiting the innermost loop.

üöß In practice, it's generally advised to avoid using labels as they can make the code less readable and harder to maintain.

```java
label1: 
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    secondLoop: 
    for(int j = 0; j < 10; j++){
        thirdLoop: 
        for(int k = 0; k < 10; k++){
            break secondLoop;
        }
    }
}
```

## continue

üìå The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.

When `continue` appears in a loop nested within another loop, you can use a **label** to specify which loop should be affected (similar to `break`).
