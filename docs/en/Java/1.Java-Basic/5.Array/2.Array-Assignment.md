# 2. ⭐Array Assignment

📌 Array assignment follows automatic type conversion.

## Automatic Type Conversion in Arrays

✅ Same type (float -> float)

```java
float[] name = {1.0, 2f, 3F};
```

✅ High precision to low precision (double -> int)

```java
double[] name = {1.0, 2.0, 3};
```

❌ Low precision cannot be converted to high precision (int --x> double)

```java
int[] name = {1, 2, 3.0};
```

❌ Incompatible types (int --x> String)

```java
int[] name = {1, 2, "hello"};
```



## Default Values in Arrays:

Default values for array elements are the same as those for primitive data types.

| Default Value |  |
| --- | --- |
| byte; short; int; long | 0 |
| float; double | 0.0 |
| char | ' ' /u000 |
| boolean | false |
| String | null |



## ⭐Array Assignment Mechanism

⚠️ Both value-passing and reference-passing involve assigning values from the stack memory to other variables. 

However, value-passing passing an independent specific value, 

While reference passing passing memory addresses pointing to the same heap space.

### Value Passing


📌 Assignment of primitive data types is usually value passing, and the assignment method is value copying (passing the current value of the variable).

```java
int n1 = 10;     // n1 = 10
int n2 = n1;     // n1 = 10; n2 = 10;
n2 = 30;         // n1 = 10; n2 = 30;
n1 = 0;          // n1 = 0; n2 = 30;
```

### Reference Passing


📌 Arrays are passed by reference by default, and the assigned value is an address. The address points to only one block of memory (passing the memory address).

```java
int[] arr1 = {1,2,3};     // arr1 = {1,2,3}
int[] arr2 = arr1;        // arr2 -> 0x12345 <- arr1 
arr2[0] = 50;             // arr1 = {50,2,3}; 
```

The address value of arr1 is assigned to arr2, meaning that arr1 and arr2 both point to the same array. In other words, arr1 and arr2 share the same block of memory.

When arr2 changes the array, it can also be observed through arr1. (It does not "affect" arr1; fundamentally, they share the same block of memory.)
