# Bubble Sort

## Sorting


ðŸ“Œ Sorting is the process of arranging multiple data items in a specified order. There are two main types of sorting: in-memory sorting and external sorting.

**In-Memory Sorting:** Involves loading all the data that needs to be processed into memory for sorting. Examples include exchange-based sorting, selection-based sorting, and insertion-based sorting.

**External Sorting:** Used when the data volume is too large to fit entirely into memory, requiring the use of external storage for sorting. Examples include merge sort and direct merge sort.



## Bubble Sort - Two Pointers

ðŸ’¡ Core idea: Iterate through the unsorted sequence from back to front (starting from the element with the largest index), comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process gradually moves the larger elements towards the end.

**Q: Given an unsorted array, use bubble sort to arrange the elements in ascending order.**

```java
int[] arr = {80, 69, 24, 57, 13};

for(int i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--){  	// Backward pointer
    for(int j = 0; j < i; j++){             // Forward pointer, should not exceed the backward pointer

        if(arr[j] > arr[j + 1]){
            // Swap the positions of the two elements (reorder)
            int temp = arr[j];
            arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
            arr[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

| pointer i | pointer j | Array                      |
| --- | --- | --- |
| i = 4 | j = 0 | [69  80]  24  57  13 |
| i = 4 | j = 1 | 69  [24  80]  57  13 |
| i = 4 | j = 2 | 69  24  [57  80]  13 |
| i = 4 | j = 3 | 69  24  57  [13  80] |
|  |  | 69  24  57  13  80 |
| i = 3 | j = 0 | [24  69]  57  13  80 |
| i = 3 | j = 1 | 24  [57  69]  13  80 |
| i = 3 | j = 2 | 24  57  [13  69]  80 |
|  |  | 24  57  13  69  80 |
| i = 2 | j = 0 | [24  57]  13  69  80 |
| i = 2 | j = 1 | 24  [13  57]  69  80 |
|  |  | 24  13  57  69  80 |
| i = 1 | j = 0 | [13  24]  57  69  80 |
| i = 0  | end  | Result: 13  24  57  69  80 |
