# Naming Rules and Conventions for Identifiers

## Naming Rules - Must Follow

ðŸ”‘ Any place where you can choose a name is called an identifier, typically variable names, method names, and class names.

1. Composed of 26 uppercase and lowercase English letters, digits 0-9, `_`, or `$`.
2. Cannot contain spaces.
3. Cannot start with a digit.
4. Cannot use keywords or reserved words in Java.
5. Java is case-sensitive, and there is no length limit.

```java
nick    // ok
nick1   // ok
1nick   // Error 3. Cannot start with a digit
n-k     // Error 1. Cannot contain "-"
n k     // Error 2. Cannot have spaces
k$4     // ok
class   // Error 4. Cannot use Java keyword
Class 	// ok, but not recommended
double  // Error 4. Cannot use Java keyword
goto    // Error 4. Cannot use Java reserved word
k4_name // ok
```

## Naming Conventions - Recommended

- **Package Names:** All lowercase when multiple words are used: `aaa.bbb.ccc`
    - For example, `com.becoze.me`

- **Class and Interface Names:** When composed of multiple words, capitalize the first letter of each word (CamelCase): `XxxYyyZzz`.
    - For example: `UserControll`

- **Variable and Method Names:** When composed of multiple words, the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter (CamelCase): `xxxYyyZzz`.
    - For example: `userLogin`

- **Constant Names:** All uppercase letters. When composed of multiple words, each word is separated by an underscore: `XXX_YYY_ZZZ`.
    - For example: Defining a constant tax rate `TAX_RATE`
