# DOS Commands and Relative & Absolute Paths

DOS stands for Disk Operation System.

## Relative & Absolute Paths

**Relative Path**: A path that starts from the current directory, forming a path.

For example: `..\..\Document b\document test 200\There.txt`

**Absolute Path**: A path that starts from the top-level directory (typically the root directory on Windows), forming a path.

For example: `D\Document b\document test 200\There.txt`

### Example: You are currently in "Document Here" and need to access "There.txt."

- D:\
  - Document a
    - **Document Here**
    - document test 200
  - Document b
    - document test 100
    - document test 200
      - **There.txt**

**Relative Path**: `..\..\Document b\document test 200\There.txt`

1. Go back to the parent directory "Document a."
2. Go back to the parent directory "D."
3. Access the "Document b" directory, then the "document test 200" directory, and finally "There.txt."

**Absolute Path**: `D\Document b\document test 200\There.txt`
