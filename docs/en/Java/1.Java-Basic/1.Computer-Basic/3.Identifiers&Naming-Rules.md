# Identifiers and Naming Rules

### Identifiers

An identifier is a character sequence used to name variables, methods, classes, and other elements in programming.

> Everywhere you can give a name is called an identifier.

```java
class IdentifierTest {
    // "IdentifierTest" is an identifier I've named.
}
```

### Naming Rules

- Must adhere to the rules to be valid.
- Consists of 26 English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers 0-9, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).
- Cannot start with a number.
- Cannot use keywords or reserved words but can contain them.
- Java is case-sensitive, and there is no maximum length.
- Identifiers cannot contain spaces.

```java
class Hello_$ { }    // Valid;
class 1Hello { }     // Invalid; cannot start with a number.
class static { }     // Invalid; "static" is a keyword.
class Static { }     // Valid; "Static" is not a keyword, and Java is case-sensitive.
class static1 { }    // Valid;
class staticVoid { } // Valid;
class Hello World{ } // Invalid; "Hello" and "World" are separated by a space, which is not allowed.
```

### Naming Conventions

- You can break conventions and still have valid code.
- **Package Names**: When composed of multiple words, use all lowercase letters: `java.util`.
- **Class and Interface Names**: When composed of multiple words, capitalize the first letter of each word: `NavigableMap`.
- **Variable and Method Names**: When composed of multiple words, lowercase the first letter of the first word, and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word: `bubbleSort`.
- **Constant Names**: All letters are uppercase, and multiple words are separated by underscores: `XXX_YYY_ZZZ`.
- When naming, it's essential to make names meaningful and "self-explanatory" to improve readability.
