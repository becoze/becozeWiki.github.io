# Addition Operation and Concatenation Operation with "+"

1. The operation is performed from left to right.
2. When both the left and right sides are numeric values, addition is performed.
3. When one side is a string, concatenation is performed.

```java
System.out.println(100 + 98);            // 198
System.out.println("100" + 98);          // 10098
System.out.println(105 + 3 + "hello");   // 108hello
System.out.println("hello" + 105 + 3);   // hello1053
```
