# Variable Definition, Basic Principles and Usage

ðŸ“Œ A variable is a value that can change and is a fundamental unit of a program. A variable has three basic elements: type + name + value.

`int a = 1;`  `int` is the type, `a` is the name, and `1` is the value.

## Basic Principles of Variables

The relationship between code and a computer mainly involves the use of memory.

`int a = 1;`

1. The variable name is `a`.
2. Allocate a space in memory of size `int` and assign it an address like `x000123`. The variable name `a` represents this address.
3. Store `1` in this memory space.
4. The variable `a` points to the address `x000123`, and this address points to the memory space containing `1`.

## Basic Usage of Variables

- Variables have different types, such as int, boolean, String.
- Variables can be converted within certain rules, e.g., type casting.
- Variables with the same name cannot exist in the same scope.
- Declare before using.

```java
int a = 1;                // Declaration
System.out.println(a);    // Usage
```
