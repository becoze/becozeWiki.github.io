# Widening Casting

![](/image/conversion.png)

ðŸ“Œ Conversion from a smaller data type to a larger one does not result in data loss.

- Boolean type is not involved in automatic conversion.



## Java Type Casting

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

- **Widening Casting** (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
  `byte` -> `short` -> `char` -> `int` -> `long` -> `float` -> `double`
- **Narrowing Casting** (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
  `double` -> `float` -> `long` -> `int` -> `char` -> `short` -> `byte`



## Maximum Precision

During calculations and assignments, a data type with smaller precision is automatically converted to a data type with the maximum precision.

```java
int n1 = 'c';    // n1 outputs 97, 'c' (default char) is automatically converted to int.
double n2 = 77;  // n2 outputs 77.0, 77 (default int) is automatically converted to double.
```

```java
float d1 = n1 + 1.1;   // Error, 1.1 is a default double and cannot be converted to a smaller precision float.
float d1 = n1 + 1.1f;  // Correct, 1.1f is a float.
```

```java
byte   num1 = 1;
int    num2 = 20;
float  num3 = 300;

double result = num1 + num2 + num3;  // Correct, the highest precision is float and can be converted to double.
int    result = num1 + num2 + num3;  // Error, the highest precision is float, and int precision is not sufficient.
```



## `char`, `byte`, and `short`

- `char` and `byte`, `char` and `short` cannot be converted to each other.
- When performing operations between `byte`, `short`, and `char`, any two of them are treated as `int`.
- When performing operations between two `char` values, they are treated as integers, and the result is an integer.

    - Correct
    
        ```java
        byte b1 = 1;
        byte b2 = b1;
        ```
        
    - Error
    
        ```java
        byte  b1 = 1;
        byte  b2 = 3;
        byte  b3 = b1 + b2; // Error, during the operation, b1 and b2 become int, and int cannot be converted to byte.
        short s4 = b1 + b2; // Error, during the operation, b1 and b2 become int, and int cannot be converted to short.
        int   i4 = b1 + b2; // Correct
        ```
