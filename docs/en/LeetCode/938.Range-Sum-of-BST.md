# 938. Range Sum of BST

# Question

Given the `root` node of a binary search tree and two integers `low` and `high`, return *the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the **inclusive** range* `[low, high]`.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23
Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
```

# Think

When current value greater than the high -> progress to left (smaller) one

When current value greater than the high -> progress to right (larger) one

when current value already in the inclusive range -> progress both left and right node

# Key

Binary Search Tree Properties: Nodes on the **right side** are greater than the current node, and nodes on the left side are smaller than the current node.



# Code

```java
public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
    if(root == null){
        return 0;
    }

    /*
         Becuase left node is always smaller and right node alwasy larger
        */
    // we progress to left (smaller) one when current value exceed the high (max)
    if(root.val > high){
        return rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high);
    }
    // we progress to right (larger) one when current value below the low (min)
    if(root.val < low){
        return rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);
    }

    // we progress both left and right node when current value already in the inclusive range
    return root.val + rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high) + rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);
}
```
