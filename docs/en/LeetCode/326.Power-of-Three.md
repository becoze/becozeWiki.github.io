# 326. Power of Three

# Question

Given an integer `n`, return *`true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`*.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3x`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 33
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).
```

# Think

This problem is different from "231. Power of Two." There is no shortcut like binary representation for powers of 2. Instead, it relies more on general mathematical patterns for n to the power of x.

`n % 3 == 0` can determine whether the current n is divisible by 3.

# Key

- When the problem only requires a boolean return, using the conditional operator in the `return` statement can efficiently check and return true or false.
- `n % 3 == 0`

# Answer

```java
public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
		// Case when n is 1
    if(n == 1){
        return true;
    }
		// As long as n can be divided by 3, divide it by 3, then check whether it is 1
		// If it cannot be divided by 3, it is not a power of 3, return false
    while(n > 0 && n % 3 == 0){
        n /= 3;
        if(n == 1){
            return true;
        }
    };
    return false;
}

// Optimized
public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    while(n > 0 && n % 3 == 0){
        n /= 3;
    }
    return n == 1; // Check and return boolean at the same time
}
```
