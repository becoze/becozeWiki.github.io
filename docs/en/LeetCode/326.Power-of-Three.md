# 326. Power of Three

Problem Link: [LeetCode - 326. Power of Three (Easy)](https://leetcode/problems/power-of-three/description/)
Related Topics: Mathematics

# Think

This problem is different from "231. Power of Two." There is no shortcut like binary representation for powers of 2. Instead, it relies more on general mathematical patterns for n to the power of x.

`n % 3 == 0` can determine whether the current n is divisible by 3.

# Key

- When the problem only requires a boolean return, using the conditional operator in the `return` statement can efficiently check and return true or false.
- `n % 3 == 0`

# Answer

```java
public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
		// Case when n is 1
    if(n == 1){
        return true;
    }
		// As long as n can be divided by 3, divide it by 3, then check whether it is 1
		// If it cannot be divided by 3, it is not a power of 3, return false
    while(n > 0 && n % 3 == 0){
        n /= 3;
        if(n == 1){
            return true;
        }
    };
    return false;
}

// Optimized
public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
    while(n > 0 && n % 3 == 0){
        n /= 3;
    }
    return n == 1; // Check and return boolean at the same time
}
