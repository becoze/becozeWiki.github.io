# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close

# Question 

Two strings are considered **close** if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

- Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.

```bash
abcde  -> aecdb
 ^  ^      ^  ^
```



- Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

```bash
aacabb -> bbcbaa
^^ ^^^    ^^ ^^^
Transform every "a" to "b" ï¼Œand "b" to "a" 
```



You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` *if* `word1` *and* `word2` *are **close**, and* `false` *otherwise.*

 

**Example 1:**

```bash
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
					 ^^ 	  ^^
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
					^ ^		 ^ ^
```

**Example 2:**

```bash
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```bash
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
					  ^  ^ 		  ^  ^
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
					^  ^^^		^  ^^^
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"
					^^^			^^^
```

# Think

1. Traverse both `word` strings and record the count of each letter.
2. Check if the lengths of the two `word` strings are the same.
3. Verify if there are common letters between the two `word` strings.
4. Check if the counts of different letters between the two `word` strings are the same.



# Key

* Determine if there are common letters between two `word` strings.

This includes the case where one word has a letter that the other does not.

```bash
word1: "aabbccf"  Contains a, b, c, f
word2: "aabbccc"  Contains a, b, c
Returns false
```



* Check if the counts of different letters between two `word` strings are the same.

Verify whether the counts of each distinct letter are the same, **without considering which word has which letter**.

```bash
word1 = "cabbba"  word2 = "abbccc"
b x 3              c x 3
a x 2              b x 2
c x 1              a x 1
--> 3,2,1          --> 3,2,1

3,2,1 == 3,2,1
Returns true
```

```bash
word1 = "cabbbb"  word2 "abbccc"
b x 4              c x 3
a x 1              b x 2
c x 1              a x 1
--> 4,1,1          --> 3,2,1

4,1,1 != 3,2,1
Returns false
```

# Code

```java
public boolean closeStrings(String word1, String word2) {
        int[] freq1 = new int[26];
        int[] freq2 = new int[26];

        // Record the count of each letter
        for (char ch : word1.toCharArray()) {
            freq1[ch - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < word2.length(); i++) {
            freq2[word2.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        // Check if there are common letters between the two words
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if ((freq1[i] == 0 && freq2[i] != 0) || (freq1[i] != 0 && freq2[i] == 0)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // Check if the counts of different letters are the same, without considering which word has which letter
        Arrays.sort(freq1);
        Arrays.sort(freq2);

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq1[i] != freq2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
