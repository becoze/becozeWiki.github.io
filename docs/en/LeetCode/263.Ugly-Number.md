# Think

Repeatedly divide `n` by 2, 3, 5,

If the final number is 1, it means that `n` does not contain factors other than 2, 3, and 5, so it is an ugly number.

If the final number is not 1, it means that `n` contains other prime factors.

# Key

The key is `repeatedly divide by 2, 3, 5`.

Method 1 uses `if` statements for 2, 3, 5 to check if they are divisible by their respective factors. However, the code is redundant.

In contrast, Method 2 can use an array to wrap the factors 2, 3, 5 that need to be `repeatedly iterated`. `int[] factors = {2, 3, 5};`, which is more convenient to iterate with a `for` loop.

# Answer

**Method 1:**

```java
public boolean isUgly(int n) {
    if(n == 1){
        return true;
    }
    if(n <= 0){
        return false;
    }
    while(true){
        if(n == 1){
            return true;
        }
        if(n % 2 == 0){
            n /= 2;
            continue;
        }
        if(n % 3 == 0){
            n /= 3;
            continue;
        }
        if(n % 5 == 0){
            n /= 5;
            continue;
        }
        break;
    }
    return false;
}
```

Optimization: 

```java
if(n % x == 0){
    n /= x;
    continue;
}
```

Only `x` changes, everything else is exactly the same. We can use the `i` in `for` loop to replace the change of `x`.

**Method 2: Optimization**

```java
public boolean isUgly(int n) {
    if(n <= 0 ){
        return false;
    }
    int[] factors = {2, 3, 5};   // <--- optimized
    for(int f : factors){
        while(n % f == 0){
            n /= f;
        }
    }
    return n == 1;
}
```
