# 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements

# Question

Youu are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, and you are allowed to rearrange the **columns** of the `matrix` in any order.

Return *the area of the largest submatrix within* `matrix` *where **every** element of the submatrix is* `1` *after reordering the columns optimally.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/29/screenshot-2020-12-30-at-40852-pm.png)

```
Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can rearrange the columns as shown above.
The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Notice that you must rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s larger than an area of 2.
```

# Think

The problem requires finding the `area` of the largest subarray, not the `steps` for rearrangement, even though we rearrange the columns to maximize the subarray.

First, for each column, we calculate the number of consecutive 1s upward, and store it in the matrix array.

Then, for each row, we sort the columns of that row and calculate the maximum rectangle area with each column as the right boundary.

# Key


ðŸ’¡ Map the 2D array to a 1D array based on certain rules

- Calculate the number of consecutive 1s upward from that column by using the operation `arr[i] += arr[i-1]`.

- Sort the row and rearrange the array to get the best condition for the largest subarray.
- Calculate the maximum rectangle area with each column as the right boundary.

# Answer

```java
public int largestSubmatrix(int[][] matrix) {
	  int m = matrix.length;
	  int n = matrix[0].length;
	  int ans = 0;
	  
	  for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
	      for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
	          if (matrix[row][col] != 0 && row > 0) { 
	              matrix[row][col] += matrix[row - 1][col];
	          }
	      }
	      
	      int[] currRow = matrix[row].clone();
	      Arrays.sort(currRow);
	      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	          ans = Math.max(ans, currRow[i] * (n - i));
	      }
	  }
	  
	  return ans;
}
