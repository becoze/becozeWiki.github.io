# Think

Numbers that are powers of 2 have a simpler and more regular pattern in binary.

```java
1  = 0000 0001 
2  = 0000 0010
4  = 0000 0100
8  = 0000 1000
16 = 0001 0000
32 = 0010 0000
64 = 0100 0000
```

# Key

If n = 4, n - 1 = 3. In binary, n = 4 (100), n - 1 = 3 = (011)

```java
  n & (n - 1)
= 4 & 3
= 0100 & 0011 
= 0

2 & (2 - 1) = 2 & 1 = 0010 & 0001 = 0
4 & (4 - 1) = 4 & 3 = 0100 & 0011 = 0
8 & (8 - 1) = 8 & 7 = 1000 & 0111 = 0
...
```


ðŸ’¡ So when n is a power of 2, n & (n - 1) = 0.

| 2^x | Decimal | n | n - 1 | n & (n - 1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2^0 | 1 | 0001 | 0000 | (0001) & (0000) == 0 |
| 2^1 | 2 | 0010 | 0001 | (0010) & (0001) == 0 |
| 2^2 | 4 | 0100 | 0011 | (0100) & (0011) == 0 |
| 2^3 | 8 | 1000 | 0111 | (1000) & (0111) == 0 |
| â€¦ | â€¦ | â€¦ | â€¦ | â€¦ |

# Answer

```java
public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
    return n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
}
```
