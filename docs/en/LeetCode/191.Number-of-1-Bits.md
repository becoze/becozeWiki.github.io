# 191. Number of 1 Bits

## Question 

Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

# Think

**Shift n**

Use >>> (unsigned right shift) to shift n, check if the last bit is 1, and continue until traversing the entire n (n=0).

```java
n = 00000000000000000000000000001011 ->
                                   ^
                                Checkpoint
```

**Shift pointer**

Use << (left shift) to shift the pointer (which is 1), check if the current bit is 1, and continue until traversing the entire n (32 times).

```java
n = 00000000000000000000000000001011 
                                <- ^
                                Checkpoint
```

# Key

**n&1;** Returns the last bit of n using n&1; in this problem, it is used to **"check if the current bit is 1."**

&: Bitwise AND: Returns 1 if both bits are 1, otherwise 0.

```java
n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
1 = 00000000000000000000000000000001
------------------------------------
n&1=00000000000000000000000000000001
```

Shift entire n to the right using n >>>

```java
n>>>00000000000000000000000000000101
n = 00000000000000000000000000000101
1 = 00000000000000000000000000000001
------------------------------------
n&1=00000000000000000000000000000001
```

# Answer

**Shift n (>>>n)**

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
  int count = 0;
  while (n != 0) {
      count += n & 1;  // if(n & 1 == 1){ count++ }
      n >>>= 1;
  }
  return count;
}
```

**Shift pointer (<<i)**

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
  int count = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
      if( (n & (1 << i)) != 0 ){
					count ++;
			}
  }
  return count;
}
```
